# Results and Analysis

**Work in Progress**

This section will document results, analysis, and findings from the simulations.

## Overview

Results from the mass-spring lattice simulations will be documented here as the research progresses.

## Planned Analysis

### Energy Conservation

- Verification of energy conservation in conservative systems
- Analysis of energy dissipation in damped systems
- Comparison of work input vs. total energy

### Dynamic Response

- Wave propagation characteristics
- Response to different force configurations
- Frequency analysis
- Mode shapes

### Parameter Studies

- Effect of spring constants
- Effect of damping coefficients
- Effect of lattice size
- Effect of force magnitude and direction

## Visualization

Animations and plots will be included here showing:
- Lattice deformation over time
- Energy evolution
- Force propagation
- Wave patterns

## Data Organization

Results will be organized by:
- Simulation type (exponential vs. linear springs)
- Parameter configurations
- Analysis type (energy, dynamics, etc.)

## Future Updates

As research progresses, this section will be updated with:
- Quantitative results
- Statistical analysis
- Comparisons with theoretical predictions
- Discussion of findings

## Notes

- All results are preliminary and subject to revision

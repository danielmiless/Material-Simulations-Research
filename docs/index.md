# Material Simulations Research Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Material Simulations Research project. This documentation provides comprehensive information about the research, methodology, models, and codebase.

## Overview

This research project investigates the dynamics of 2D mass-spring lattice systems using exponential spring models. The work is conducted in collaboration with Dr. Romesh Batra, Distinguished Professor and Clifton C. Garvin Professor, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Virginia Tech.
